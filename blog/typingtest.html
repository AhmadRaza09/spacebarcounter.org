                                    <p>It is the most usual and the most effective method. The typist focuses on the source rather than the keyboard and screen in this method. When you don't look at the keyboard, typing speed automatically improves. Almost every typing specialist uses touch type for typing.</p>
                                    <h4>Hunt & Peck: </h4>

                                    <h4>Hybrid:</h4>
                                    <p>This method is the combination of Touch Typing and the Hunt & Peck technique. In this method, the typist remembers the console layout and focuses on the screen. The typist jams the fingers on the keyboard button to speed up their typing. They only move their finger while typing.</p>

                                    <h4>Thumbing:</h4>
                                    <p>Thumbing is the most advanced typing method. After the advancement in smartphones and tab, this novel method has evolved. In this technique, the person practices with their both thumb to type. This typing method is beneficial only on small devices.</p><br>
